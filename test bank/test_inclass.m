% 1a.  Make x equal to a matrix that has the 0 to 20 in the first
% row and 20 to 40 in the second row and 40 to 60 in the third row. 
x = [ 0:20 ; 20:40; 40:60 ];

% 1b.  Make x equal to a 10 x 2 matrix that has numbers from -9 to 0 
% in the first column and from 1 to 10 in the second column.
x = reshape( -9:10, [ 10 2 ] );

% 2.  Make x equal to a 1 x 5 row vector of 5 linearly spaced numbers
% between 0 and 1 (both included):
x = linspace(0,1,5)';
% or
x = (0:.25:1)';

% 3.  Make x equal to a 8 x 3 matrix of random numbers uniformly drawn from
% the interval between -1 and 1
x = 2*rand( 8, 3 ) -1;

% 4.  In the following questions, use a matrix m that is a 4 x 25 matrix of
% normally distributed random numbers.  Resample a new matrix m for each
% question, e.g., don't let any changes to the matrix m in part (a) affect
% the matrix m that you use in part (b).
m = randn( 4, 25 );

% 4a.  Make x equal to the third column of m.
x = m( :, 3 );

% 4b.  Make x equal to the last row of m.
x = m( end, : );

% 4c.  Suppose you didn't know the size of matrix m.  Set a equal to the
% number of rows in m, and b equal to the number of columns.
[ a, b ] = size( m );

% 4d.  Suppose you didn't know the size of matrix m.  Set c equal to the
% number of elements in m.
c = numel( m );

% 4e.  Make x a row vector with elements that are the average of each row
% of m.
x = mean( m, 2 )'; 
% OR
x = mean( m' );

%% TEST 2 STARTS HERE

% 4f.  Redefine m (see above). Make x equal to the number of elements of m smaller than -1.5

m = randn( 4, 25 );
x = numel(m>-1.5)

% 4g.  Make x equal to all the elements of m that are less than -1 or
% greater than .5

% 4h.  Make x equal to one if any elements are between -.01 and .01 and 0 if
% no elements are in that range

% 4i.  Set any elements of m in the second row that are bigger than 1 to
% NaN.

% 4j. Redefine m. Make x equal to the number of columns whose sum is bigger than .5

% 4k. Delete the second, fifth and tenth column of m.

% 4l.  Redefine m. Set f equal to the linear indices of the elements of m
% that are bigger than .25.

% 4m.  Use f to set the elements of m that are less than zero to NaN.

% 5.  Write a function called test_remain that takes two input arguments a and b, 
% returns the remainder after dividing a by b if the inputs are both
% positive, and NaN otherwise. 

% 6.  Write a function called test_randomize that takes any two-dimensional
% matrix as input, and returns a matrix of the same size, but with the
% values randomly shuffled. Bonus if you can make the function handle
% higher-dimensional matrices

% 7.  Write a for loop that prints any number between 1 and 1000 that is divisible by 9 

% 8.  Use a while loop to populate a variable prime_list containing 
% the first 8 prime numbers bigger than 100
