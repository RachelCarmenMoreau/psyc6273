Dr. Alyssa Counsell in the Department of Psychology at Ryerson is interested in examining how attitudes towards statistics and statistical software change across the duration of one semester in a statistics course. She has designed an online questionnaire that will take about 30 minutes of your time. For participating, you will be entered into a draw to win a $150 Amazon gift card. The survey is completely voluntary and confidential. In fact, your course director will never know whether you participated or how you answered the survey questions. More information about the study and researcher is included at:

The online survey is open until December 30, 2019.

Please note that you are still eligible to participate even if you did complete part 1 of the survey at the beginning of the semester.
