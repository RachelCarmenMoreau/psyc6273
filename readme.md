**Overview.**  This graduate course covers computer programming methods that are useful in experimental psychology.  The course assumes no previous programming experience, and brings students to the point where they are able to write useful programs to advance their own research.  Classes are held in a computer laboratory, and each class consists of a lecture followed by programming practice on assigned problems.  Topics include the MATLAB programming language, data files, curve fitting, Monte Carlo simulations, statistical tests, journal-quality data plots, 2D and 3D graphics, and interfacing to external devices.
